ThrottledCsv
============

this plugin hopes to extract out several key features of exporting db data
to csv that seemed to be needed.

heavily inspired by Andrew Timberlake 
http://ramblingsonrails.com/download-a-large-amount-of-data-in-csv-from-rails

throttled - it will download as it's generated to mitigate memory usage for
						large datasets
dynamic fields - will allow for attributes as well as methods, pick and 
								choose what you want the columns to be
black-box - now it's simply a method you define an options hash for in the
						controller, making it trivial to add future csv exports

Options
=======

:db_table - name of primary database table with the data
:label - will be concatenated with datetime for resulting filename
:include - used for joins with main model, use just like activerecord
:scope - AR model with scopes used as the basis for an AR find
:fields - array of columns to export in csv.  Can use association or custom methods
:header (optional)- labels for top header row of csv, can be anything you want.  
         If not defined will autofill with humanized version of :fields.

Example
=======

using the following db tables:

create_table "users", :force => true do |t|
  t.string   "email"
  t.string   "crypted_password",              :limit => 40
  t.string   "salt",                          :limit => 40
  t.datetime "created_at"
  t.datetime "updated_at"
  t.integer  "country_id"
  t.string   "nickname"
  t.string   "first_name"
  t.string   "last_name"
end

create_table "countries", :force => true do |t|
  t.string   "name"
end

your controller action will look like thus:

def users
	@users = User.all
	respond_to do |format|
		format.html
		format.csv do
	  options = {
	    :db_table => "users",
	    :label => "user_export",
	    :include => [:country]
	    :scope => @users,
	    :fields => ["id","nickname","email","first_name","last_name","country.name","created_at"],
	    :header => ["ID","Nickname","Email","First Name","Last Name","Country","Created At"]
	  }
	  render_to_csv(options)
	end
end
